## the-hypothesis
Usage of face recognition systems imposes various constraints on an input data. One of them - the spatial size of the input image, as a rule, the height, and width of the input image has to be equal to the input of the used model (network based). 

However, in practice, there are often cases when the target object in a frame has a smaller size than the size of the entrance window of the network, which may a negatively affects to the quality of facial recognition.
