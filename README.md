## hypothesis
Usage of face recognition systems imposes various constraints on an input data. One of them - the spatial size of the input image, as a rule, the height, and width of the input image has to be equal to the input of the used model (network based). 

However, in practice, there are often cases when the target object in a frame has a smaller size than the size of the entrance window of the network, which may a negatively affects the quality of facial recognition. 

One of the possible solutions to this problem may consist of the following - artificially increase the resolution of the target image up to the size of the input and find out
how the enhancement of image resolution and different types of enhancement affect the final accuracy.
